My “career” in pizza started with a fib I told my wife when I first met her, foolishly boasting a history of making home made pizzas when I had never once tried my hand at the craft. The result was not the “prettyboys” you see today but rather a “pretty boy” that she would playfully ridicule me about for years to come. Like a super villain on an arc towards revenge, I have spent the last 8+ years working in shops up the west coast honing my craft to show the haters (my unwaveringly supportive wife) what I’m made of. A culmination of working in different kitchens with different styles of pizza have landed me HERE crafting a not quite grandmother, not quite Detroit, not quite focaccia, party pizza. Designed with the sole purpose of feeding your pals pizza hot from the oven or cold from the fridge and hitting the spot every time.
